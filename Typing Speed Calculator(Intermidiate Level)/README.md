## Typing Speed Calculator

### Developer: Swetank Raut

### Overview
The Typing Speed Calculator is a Python program designed to measure a user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM), provide accuracy feedback, and show the time required to type a given text. This project is a practical application for improving typing skills and assessing typing performance.

### Features
- **Typing Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
- **Accuracy Measurement**: It measures the accuracy of the typed text in percentage.
- **Time Tracking**: The program records and displays the time taken to type the given text.
- **Error Counting**: Counts the number of errors made while typing the text.

### How It Works
1. **Prompt to Start**: The program prompts the user to start the typing test by entering "Yes" or "No".
2. **Display Sentence**: If the user is ready, a random sentence is chosen and displayed for the user to type.
3. **Record Time**: The program records the time taken from the moment the user starts typing to when they finish.
4. **Calculate Results**:
   - **Speed**: Calculates the typing speed in WPM.
   - **Accuracy**: Calculates the accuracy of the typed text as a percentage.
   - **Time Taken**: Displays the time taken to type the given text.
5. **Display Results**: The results, including speed, accuracy, and time taken, are displayed to the user.
6. **Repeat or Exit**: The user can choose to take another test or exit the program.

### Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to start the typing test.
3. Type the displayed sentence as accurately and quickly as possible.
4. View the results (speed, accuracy, and time taken).
5. Choose to take another test or exit the program.
